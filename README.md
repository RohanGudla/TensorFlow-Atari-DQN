# DQN-Atari-Tensorflow Implementation

Recreating the "Human-Level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning" using TensorFlow.

This implementation serves as a straightforward approach to train a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for playing Atari Games.

The pretrained network will be made available soon!

## Prerequisites

1. TensorFlow (preferably with GPU CUDA support)
2. OpenCV2
3. Arcade Learning Environment ( [https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment) )

## Setup and Execution

```bash
git clone https://github.com/songrotek/DQN-Atari-Tensorflow.git

cd DQN-Atari-Tensorflow
python AtariDQN.py
```
